SOME FIXES TO DO:
 - select block placement in empty spots sometimes
 - figure out and fix the walls between chunks
 - when inserting block, make sure to not do certain things for blocks on side of chunk
 - actually i think the chunk side wall thing is because its not getting the right block when trying to clear or place on edge cus of indexing idk


create some ui for the block placement

TRY to fix the small bug with select block that sometimes happens along the border of a chunk with another chunk

fix the grainy stuff in the water

water animations???

create tree generation

create distance fog idk it just looks cool

make it so that the world is somehow infinite

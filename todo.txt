WHAT THE FUK IS THAT BLACK VOID THING WHEN U GO TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP (it might have been a one time thing because i tested again and it didnt appear)

get block deletion properly working between chunks

fix the select block bug that happens

SOME FIXES TO DO:
 - select block placement in empty spots sometimes
 - when inserting block, make sure to not do certain things for blocks on side of chunk
 - actually i think the chunk side wall thing is because its not getting the right block when trying to clear or place on edge cus of indexing idk


create some ui for the block placement

TRY to fix the small bug with select block that sometimes happens along the border of a chunk with another chunk

fix the grainy stuff in the water

make the water generation work properly bec theres a lot of it thats generated underground where it shouldnt be

remove the invisible faces that are drawn when rendering water blocks (if its not too much effort, otherwise its ok)

create tree generation

create distance fog idk it just looks cool

make it so that the world is somehow infinite

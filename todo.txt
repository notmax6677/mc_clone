WHAT THE FUK IS THAT BLACK VOID THING WHEN U GO TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP (it might have been a one time thing because i tested again and it didnt appear)

find out a decent looking layout for the stars

why is it so slow when running in wireframe mode

create stars that appear at night, and that'll be the end of the day/night cycle system

create tree generation

create some ui for the block placement

TRY to fix the small bug with select block that sometimes happens along the border of a chunk with another chunk

fix the grainy stuff in the water

create distance fog idk it just looks cool

make it so that the world is somehow infinite

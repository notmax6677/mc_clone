T for toggle water

what is this little bug with like the day, when you press N and make it day and then resume the cycle, sometimes it creates another day afterwards

why is it so slow when running in wireframe mode

create stars that appear at night, and that'll be the end of the day/night cycle system

create tree generation

create some ui for the block placement

TRY to fix the small bug with select block that sometimes happens along the border of a chunk with another chunk

fix the grainy stuff in the water

create distance fog idk it just looks cool

make it so that the world is somehow infinite

## Small Description
So this project was mainly a product of my own curiosity that was heavily inspired by [JDH's Minecraft series](https://github.com/jdah/minecraft-weekend),
I already attempted something like this with C++ a bit more than a year ago and failed massively, so this summer I had another go at it after taking a long break from OpenGL,
which I admit wasn't much of an efficient choice, as I had to kinda re-learn some elements and concepts on-the-go. In the end though, it did work out, so enjoy :)
